These features are on both the internal and the script unless said otherwise in the gray.
I won't list every feature we have because the internal has more to keep it buyers-only hidden, but here's a preview of what we have:

Aimbot Features

* Distance check
* Smoothness
* Easing style
* Easing direction
* Customizable hit-parts such as --// Closest Point, Closest Part, Nearest Point, HitPart Name, or Table (Internal has even more accurate hit-points such as "best point" similar to Osiris.)
* Closest-Point Modes such as scaled & regular
* X,Y,Z Prediction editor
* Customizable FOV
* Clamp Y Axis --// Use this if shooting ground, stabilizes the Y velocity axis to prevent overshoot. Comes with dynamic option + clamp editor
* Y Override Axis --// Internal only feature + universal
* ANTIAIM VIEWER --// This is on automatically inside any game we support so no pesky mods can catch you cheating
* Humanizer --// Internal only feature + with sample styles

Silent-Aim Features

* Target mode --// Like a dot-lock: you press a button and a line visual appears showing who you're targeting until you unlock
* FOV MODE 
* Distance check
* Checks --// Knocked check, wall-check, etc. The basic necessities. These are on the aimbot as well
* Client redirection --// Will not redirect the bullet on your screen only. On other people's screens, your bullets will go towards them. Only makes you look legit from YOUR POV
* Customizable hit-parts such as --// Closest Point, Closest Part, Nearest Point, HitPart Name, or Table (Internal has even more accurate hit-points such as "best point" similar to Osiris.)
* X,Y,Z Prediction editor
* Clamp Y Axis --// Use this if shooting ground, stabilizes the Y velocity axis to prevent overshoot. Comes with dynamic option + clamp editor
* 2D/3D FOV Modes --// FOVs automatically stick to the target and are not followed by your mouse (modes)
* ANTIAIM VIEWER --// This is on automatically inside any game we support so no pesky mods can catch you cheating
* Customizable FOV
* Anti-Curve + Angle editor --// Internal only feature but the script has a built-in anti-curve for most games

Triggerbot Features

* Distance check
* Cooldown --// Basically triggerbot delay fast / slow
* X,Y,Z Prediction
* Activation Modes --// Such as keybind/mouse button to activate the triggerbot & Toggle/Hold mode
* Customizable FOV --// FOVs automatically stick to the target and are not followed by your mouse
* 2D FOV Mode --// With 2D prediction

Player Modifications

* Walkspeed
* Anti-Fall
* Anti-Trip

Weapon Exploits

* Spread modifications --// You can add any weapon with its full name and the value for it. e.g: \['\[LMG]'] = { \['Value'] = true } etc.
* Double tap --// Shooting once will shoot 2 bullets, killing your target even faster
* Weapon delay changer
* Client redirection
* Instant kill --// For some remakes

+ EVEN MORE. If you aren’t using Ecco, I don’t know what you're waiting for. We are dominating Da Hood including all the remakes. We plan to expand soon, but until then, enjoy.
